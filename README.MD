## I conceptualized and developed an interactive Whack-a-Mole game for the web, leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a testament to my proficiency in front-end web development and game design.

### Technologies Used:

- HTML: Structured the game's web page and user interface elements.
- CSS: Styled the game elements for an appealing and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Developed the game's logic, including mole spawning, player input, scoring, and timer management.
